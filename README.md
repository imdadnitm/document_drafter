# README

Install RoR to run this app localy. Will add more detailed steps later when the project is complete.

The idea is -

User would upload a word doc template with placeholders in it. The placeholders would be in the format {{data_type#field_name}}
Then the users would be able to generate a new document using these uploaded templates. The form for generating the documents would show these
placeholders/ field names in readable format dynamically ( based on the seletion of the template ) without needing the user to configure anything else in the application.

The user can fill the details in the placeholder field names when displayed and click generate document.

More features to come as well.
